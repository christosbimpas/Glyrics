This sample SwiftUI project demonstrates using MusicKit to play a song and display its official lyrics in sync with playback. Users can also tap a button to reveal phonetic and translated versions of the lyrics. Replace `APPLE_MUSIC_TRACK_ID` in `ContentView.swift` with the Apple Music track ID for "Χωρίς το μωρό μου" by Anna Vissi.
